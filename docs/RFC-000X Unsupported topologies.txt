Good. Then this one gets written like a **rejection letter from the universe**.
Clear, explicit, unapologetic.

What follows is a **normative companion RFC**.
Anything listed here is not “unsupported for now.”
It is **structurally incompatible** with LegiVellum.

# RFC-LV-000X

## Anti-Patterns We Refuse to Support

*(Some Things Are Unnatural)*

**Status:** Draft
**Category:** Informational (Hard Prohibitions)
**Applies to:** All LegiVellum-based systems and derivatives
**Audience:** Architects, implementers, optimizers, “clever people”

---

## 1. Purpose

LegiVellum is intentionally permissive in composition, but **not morally neutral** in structure.

This document enumerates architectural anti-patterns that:

* violate the Core Axiom
* collapse responsibility boundaries
* introduce hidden control
* or create systems that cannot be reasoned about post hoc

These patterns are **explicitly refused**.

If your use case requires one of them, LegiVellum is the wrong system.
Use something else. You will be happier.

---

## 2. The Hidden Master Anti-Pattern

### Description

A component (or model) that:

* always knows “what’s going on”
* decides what happens next
* routes work implicitly
* or must be running for the system to function

Often disguised as:

* “coordinator”
* “orchestrator”
* “controller”
* “manager”
* “brain”

### Why It Is Unnatural

It violates:

* lease-encoded authority
* role ephemerality
* receipt-based narrative

It recentralizes power while pretending not to.

### Observable Symptoms

* System halts if one component goes down
* Logic exists nowhere except “in the head” of a process
* Post-incident analysis devolves into storytelling

### Status

**Refused.**
LegiVellum does not have kings.

---

## 3. Implicit Progress Tracking

### Description

Inferring task completion, success, or failure by:

* timeouts
* heuristics
* polling state
* “it probably finished by now”

Instead of explicit receipts.

### Why It Is Unnatural

Progress is a **claim**, not a feeling.

If it matters, it must be recorded.

### Observable Symptoms

* Phantom retries
* Duplicate work
* Silent partial failures
* Operators asking “did it actually run?”

### Status

**Refused.**
AsyncGate does not guess. Neither should you.

---

## 4. MemoryGate as an Actor

### Description

Using MemoryGate to:

* trigger workflows
* initiate tasks
* schedule follow-ups
* “notice something and act”

### Why It Is Unnatural

Memory is passive by design.

Turning memory into agency creates:

* invisible feedback loops
* non-deterministic behavior
* impossible debugging

### Observable Symptoms

* Actions with no clear initiator
* “it happened because it was stored”
* system behavior changing after data replays

### Status

**Refused.**
MemoryGate remembers. It does not awaken.

---

## 5. Push-Based Execution

### Description

AsyncGate (or equivalent) pushing work directly to workers instead of workers pulling via lease polling.

Often justified as:

* “efficiency”
* “lower latency”
* “simpler mental model”

### Why It Is Unnatural

Push collapses:

* capability discovery
* backpressure
* autonomy
* failure isolation

It turns workers into puppets.

### Observable Symptoms

* Cascading failures
* Overloaded executors
* Tight coupling between broker and worker

### Status

**Refused.**
Responsibility is offered, not shoved.

---

## 6. Implicit Replanning by Executors

### Description

CogniGate or workers that:

* decide to break tasks into subtasks
* create new work orders
* reroute execution

…without explicit lease authority.

### Why It Is Unnatural

Execution and planning are different kinds of cognition.

Blurring them creates:

* runaway recursion
* invisible scope creep
* loss of accountability

### Observable Symptoms

* Task explosion
* “helpful” behavior that cannot be traced
* costs growing without explanation

### Status

**Refused.**
Planning requires consent.

---

## 7. Authority by Configuration Side Effects

### Description

Granting power because:

* a component can reach an endpoint
* a tool happens to be exposed
* credentials exist in the environment

Instead of explicit lease permissions.

### Why It Is Unnatural

Reachability is not authorization.

This pattern creates **ambient authority**, which always leaks.

### Observable Symptoms

* Security reviews that end in silence
* “it shouldn’t have been able to do that”
* emergency revocations after the fact

### Status

**Refused.**
Authority must be declared, scoped, and time-bounded.

---

## 8. Global Shared Mutable State

### Description

Using shared variables, caches, or in-memory coordination as:

* truth
* synchronization
* control flow

Especially across components.

### Why It Is Unnatural

LegiVellum is distributed by assumption.

Shared mutable state is a lie the system will eventually punish.

### Observable Symptoms

* Race conditions
* Heisenbugs
* State that “fixes itself” when restarted

### Status

**Refused.**
If it matters, write a receipt.

---

## 9. Silent Success

### Description

Work that:

* “just runs”
* produces output
* but emits no receipt asserting completion or outcome

### Why It Is Unnatural

Silence is indistinguishable from absence.

In LegiVellum, silence means **nothing happened**.

### Observable Symptoms

* Missing artifacts
* Duplicate execution
* Operators asking “was this already done?”

### Status

**Refused.**
Success must speak for itself.

---

## 10. Topology-as-Fate

### Description

Hard-coding assumptions like:

* “there will only ever be one AsyncGate”
* “this Delegate is special”
* “this component must always exist”

### Why It Is Unnatural

LegiVellum is designed to fracture, recurse, and federate.

Topology is a deployment choice, not a law of nature.

### Observable Symptoms

* Inability to scale or partition
* “we’d have to rewrite everything to do that”
* brittle upgrades

### Status

**Refused.**
Topology is contextual. Design accordingly.

---

## 11. Final Prohibition

If your design relies on:

* implicit knowledge
* invisible authority
* emergent control
* or “we’ll just remember how it works”

Then you are not building a LegiVellum system.

You are building a haunted machine.

---

## Closing Note (Deliberately Unfriendly)

These anti-patterns are common because they feel *convenient*.

They are also how systems become:

* unmaintainable
* untrustworthy
* and eventually abandoned

LegiVellum refuses them not out of ideology,
but out of experience.

Some things are just unnatural.
