# CorpoVellum Alignment Notes (Canonical)

Role in LegiVellum:
- Enterprise distribution with governance, isolation, and policy enforcement

Required contract behavior:
- Must adhere to core LegiVellum contracts (receipts, artifacts, bootstrap)
- Adds enterprise controls without altering primitive boundaries

Alignment status:
- **Extension**: proprietary distribution; should remain compatible with
  canonical contracts defined in `LegiVellum/docs/canonical/`.
