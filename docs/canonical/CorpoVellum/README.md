# CorpoVellum

**CorpoVellum** is the enterprise distribution of **LegiVellum**: governed cognitive infrastructure for agentic systems operating at organizational scale.

Where LegiVellum provides open, principled primitives for memory, receipts, plans, and temporal continuity, CorpoVellum adds the structures institutions require: governance, isolation, policy, and guarantees.

This repository contains **proprietary commercial code** and is not open source.

## Canonical Alignment (LegiVellum)

CorpoVellum inherits LegiVellum contracts:
- Validation is performed by the LegiVellum platform layer.
- Required primitives: MetaGate, ReceiptGate, DepotGate.
- Receipts are stored in ReceiptGate; artifacts in DepotGate; knowledge in MemoryGate.

## What CorpoVellum Is

CorpoVellum exists for environments where:

- AI systems must be **accountable**
- Memory becomes **evidence**
- Forgetting becomes **risk**
- Actions have **organizational consequences**

It provides the same cognitive substrate as LegiVellum, extended with features required by teams, enterprises, and regulated contexts.

In short:

> **LegiVellum remembers.  
> CorpoVellum enforces.**

## Core Capabilities

CorpoVellum builds on the LegiVellum architecture and adds:

- Multi-tenant isolation
- Organizational access control (RBAC / policy enforcement)
- Audit trails and retention guarantees
- Governed receipt and plan stores
- Administrative and compliance tooling
- Managed deployment and operational controls
- Enterprise security posture and hardening

Not all features are present in all builds. This repository represents active development.

## Relationship to LegiVellum

- **LegiVellum** is open-source cognitive infrastructure  
- **CorpoVellum** is the commercial, governed distribution

The projects share architectural lineage but are licensed and developed separately.

LegiVellum remains open and principled.
CorpoVellum exists because organizations operate under different constraints.

## Final Note

CorpoVellum is not a toy, a demo, or a marketing artifact.

It exists because once systems remember,  
**someone must be responsible for what they remember.**
