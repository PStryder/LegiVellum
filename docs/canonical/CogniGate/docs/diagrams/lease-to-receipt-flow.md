This diagram shows the complete flow from work claim to receipt delivery.

    participant AG as AsyncGate
    participant WP as WorkPoller
    participant JE as JobExecutor
    participant AI as AI Provider

    participant MCP as MCP Server

    Note over WP: Polling loop starts

    loop Every polling_interval

        alt No work available
            AG-->>WP: 200 OK (empty tasks)

            Note over WP: Lease received
            WP->>WP: Track active job
            WP->>WP: Start heartbeat task

            WP->>JE: execute(lease)

            Note over JE: Job execution begins
            JE->>JE: Load instruction profile
            JE->>JE: Build system prompt

            loop Execution steps (max iterations)

                    JE->>JE: Append results to conversation
                else No tool calls (final response)
                    JE->>JE: Extract final response
                    Note over JE: Job complete
                end
            end

            JE-->>WP: Receipt (COMPLETE/FAILED)

            WP->>WP: Stop heartbeat
            WP->>AG: asyncgate.complete

            alt Receipt delivery success
                AG-->>WP: 200 OK
                WP->>WP: Clear job tracking
            else Receipt delivery fails
                Note over WP: Retry with backoff
                loop Max retries
                    WP->>AG: asyncgate.complete

                        WP->>WP: Exponential backoff wait
                    end
                end
                Note over WP: Dead letter queue
                WP->>WP: Store in DLQ
            end

## Key Points

1. **Polling**: WorkPoller continuously polls AsyncGate for available work
2. **Lease Tracking**: Active jobs are tracked for graceful shutdown support
3. **Heartbeat**: Background task extends lease during long-running jobs
4. **Execution**: JobExecutor handles the AI conversation loop
5. **Tool Calls**: ToolExecutor dispatches to MCP servers
6. **Receipt Delivery**: Retries with exponential backoff, falls back to DLQ
