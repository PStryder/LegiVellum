MemoryGate Privacy Policy

Last updated: January 2026

1. Overview

MemoryGate is a memory-as-a-service platform designed to provide persistent, user-controlled memory for AI systems and applications.
Our service exists solely to store, retrieve, and manage data that you explicitly choose to persist.

We take privacy seriously because trust is the entire product.

This policy explains:

what data we store,

why we store it,

how it is protected,

and how you can delete it.

2. What Data We Collect

MemoryGate stores only data explicitly sent to the service by you or your application.

This may include:

short text memories or summaries,

structured metadata you provide (domains, confidence scores, tags),

timestamps related to storage and access,

identifiers required to associate data with your account or AI instance.

We do not:

collect full chat transcripts unless you send them,

scrape data from your conversations,

infer or reconstruct context beyond what is explicitly submitted.

3. Why We Store This Data

MemoryGate stores data for one reason only:

To provide persistent memory functionality across sessions and systems.

Retention is not incidental—it is the service.

Stored data enables:

recall across conversations,

semantic search,

summarization and memory consolidation,

user-directed archiving and deletion.

We do not use your data for analytics, training, advertising, profiling, or any secondary purpose.

4. How We Use (and Do Not Use) Your Data
Permitted use

Processing requests you initiate (store, search, retrieve, summarize).

Maintaining service integrity (e.g. indexing, encryption, backups).

Explicitly prohibited use

We do not:

read or review customer data for curiosity or content analysis,

share data with third parties,

sell data,

use data to train models,

mine data for behavioral insights.

Access to stored data by operators is strictly limited and logged, and only permitted for security or operational necessity.

5. Data Isolation and Access Control

Each customer’s data is:

logically isolated from other customers,

accessible only via authenticated credentials,

protected by role-based access controls.

Requests are authorized per account and scoped to that account’s data only.

6. Encryption and Security
In transit

All data is encrypted in transit using industry-standard TLS.

At rest

All stored data is encrypted at rest using strong cryptographic standards (e.g. AES-256).

Key management

Encryption keys are managed using secure key-management practices and are not stored alongside the encrypted data.

Design intent: MemoryGate is being architected so that operators do not have routine access to decrypted customer data. Where decryption is required for service operation, it occurs in controlled execution paths only.

As the service evolves, we intend to further reduce operator visibility through stronger cryptographic separation.

7. Data Retention

MemoryGate retains data for as long as you choose to retain it.

Retention behavior includes:

active memory storage,

optional summarization and archiving,

cold storage of unused data,

eventual deletion if configured by you.

Retention policies are configurable and transparent.

8. Deletion and Data Subject Rights (GDPR)

You retain full control over your data.

You may:

delete individual memory entries,

delete categories or time ranges of data,

delete all data associated with your account.

Deletion requests are honored promptly and permanently, subject only to minimal technical delays (e.g. backup rotation).

If you are located in the EU or UK, you have the right to:

access your data,

correct inaccurate data,

request deletion (“right to be forgotten”),

receive a copy of your data in a structured format.

Requests can be made through documented service interfaces or by contacting us directly.

9. Data Sharing

We do not share your data with anyone.

No partners.
No advertisers.
No affiliates.
No training pipelines.

Data is disclosed only if required by law, and only to the extent legally mandated.

10. Logs and Telemetry

Operational logs are limited to:

request metadata,

error information,

performance metrics.

Logs are designed to avoid storing memory content or personally identifiable information.

11. Compliance and Standards

MemoryGate is built to meet or exceed:

SOC 2 security principles,

GDPR requirements,

industry best practices for secure SaaS platforms.

Security controls, access reviews, and change management are part of our ongoing operations.

12. Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, we will update the “Last updated” date and provide notice for material changes.
