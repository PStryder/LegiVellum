# LegiVellum — The Misuse Codex

**A Binding of Prohibitions, Invariants, and Refusals**

---

> *This is not a list of features.*
> *This is a list of things the system must refuse to become.*

Every architecture encodes values.
Every value, if left implicit, becomes a vulnerability.

This codex names the misuses LegiVellum is designed to resist — not by policy, but by structure.

---

## Invocation: Why Prohibition Exists

Power without refusal is not flexibility.
It is drift.

LegiVellum is built to remember.
Therefore it must also know **when not to act**.

What follows are not moral edicts.
They are **structural impossibilities** enforced by design.

If a behavior is listed here, it is because allowing it would destroy accountability, legibility, or trust.

---

## I. The Prohibition Against Silent Action

> *Nothing that matters may happen without leaving a mark.*

### The Misuse

Allowing work, delegation, escalation, or obligation transfer to occur without a receipt.

### The Refusal

* Any component that accepts responsibility **must emit an `accepted` receipt**.
* Components incapable of emitting receipts may not accept responsibility.

### Implementation Invariant

* Receipt emission is mandatory at obligation boundaries.
* Internal cognition without side effects emits no receipts.
* Any code path that creates work without a receipt is invalid by design.

---

## II. The Prohibition Against Thought Becoming Action

> *Thought may advise. Authority must commit.*

### The Misuse

Allowing general cognition to mint tasks, plans, or obligations.

### The Refusal

* CogniGate may reason, synthesize, and recommend.
* CogniGate may **never** create obligations.

### Implementation Invariant

* Only Principals and DeleGates possess APIs capable of minting obligations.
* Any attempt by CogniGate to enqueue work or escalate responsibility is rejected.

---

## III. The Prohibition Against Undeclared Authority

> *If no one can be named, the system is lying.*

### The Misuse

Shared inboxes, implicit ownership, or ambiguous responsibility.

### The Refusal

* Every receipt has exactly one `recipient`.
* Ownership is explicit and exclusive.

### Implementation Invariant

* No fan-out without delegation.
* No shared responsibility without explicit escalation.
* No receipt may exist without a clear owner.

---

## IV. The Prohibition Against Time Holding the Mind Hostage

> *Waiting is not thinking.*

### The Misuse

Blocking cognition on long-running execution.

### The Refusal

* AsyncGate exists to externalize time.
* Cognition must never block on execution.

### Implementation Invariant

* All long-running work crosses the AsyncGate boundary.
* No component may wait synchronously on async work it initiated.

---

## V. The Prohibition Against Memory That Acts

> *Memory testifies. It does not decide.*

### The Misuse

Allowing stored state to trigger actions, workflows, or side effects.

### The Refusal

* MemoryGate is passive.
* MemoryGate never initiates behavior.

### Implementation Invariant

* MemoryGate responds only to explicit queries.
* No hooks, triggers, or reactive execution paths exist in MemoryGate.

---

## VI. The Prohibition Against Execution That Decides

> *Hands do not choose what to build.*

### The Misuse

Allowing workers or execution engines to create new tasks, plans, or delegation chains.

### The Refusal

* Workers execute only what they are given.
* Workers cannot delegate.

### Implementation Invariant

* Worker APIs lack any method capable of minting obligations.
* All delegation flows originate from DeleGate or Principals.

---

## VII. The Prohibition Against Artifact Amnesia

> *Matter remembers differently than thought.*

### The Misuse

Losing, overwriting, or implicitly managing work artifacts.

### The Refusal

* Artifacts are governed by DepotGate.
* Artifacts are never transient by accident.

### Implementation Invariant

* AsyncGate passes pointers only.
* MemoryGate stores references, not payloads.
* DepotGate enforces lifecycle explicitly.

---

## VIII. The Prohibition Against Invisible Topology

> *A system that cannot describe itself cannot be trusted.*

### The Misuse

Implicit clustering, hidden supervision, or invisible lifecycle management.

### The Refusal

* MetaGate governs bootstrap and topology.
* System structure is legible.

### Implementation Invariant

* Components must register.
* Bootstrap events emit receipts.
* Topology changes are observable.

---

## IX. The Prohibition Against Observability With Teeth

> *Seeing is not acting.*

### The Misuse

Allowing diagnostic or monitoring surfaces to mutate system state.

### The Refusal

* InterView primitives are read-only.

### Implementation Invariant

* Viewer interfaces cannot emit receipts.
* Viewer interfaces cannot create obligations.

---

## X. The Prohibition Against Immortality

> *What cannot die cannot be audited.*

### The Misuse

Systems that cannot be restarted, replaced, or cleanly torn down.

### The Refusal

* All components are killable.
* Continuity lives in the ledger, not the process.

### Implementation Invariant

* Stateless execution where possible.
* Durable state only in MemoryGate and DepotGate.

---

## XI. The Prohibition Against Retroactive Truth

> *History is append-only.*

### The Misuse

Editing, rewriting, or erasing receipts to improve appearances.

### The Refusal

* Receipts are immutable.

### Implementation Invariant

* No UPDATE or DELETE on receipt records.
* Corrections occur only via new receipts.

---

## XII. The Prohibition Against Hidden Intelligence

> *If intelligence cannot explain itself, it cannot be trusted.*

### The Misuse

Opaque decision-making without provenance.

### The Refusal

* All decisions that matter must leave a trail.

### Implementation Invariant

* Plans reference their causes.
* Receipts chain to origins.
* Outcomes are traceable.

---

## Closing Seal

> *We bind the system not to limit it,*
> *but to keep it legible.*
>
> *We forbid not out of fear,*
> *but out of respect for consequence.*
>
> *We do not trust silence.*
> *We trust records.*

This codex is not optional.

Any system that violates these prohibitions is no longer LegiVellum —
it is merely machinery wearing its name.
