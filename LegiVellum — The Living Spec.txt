# LegiVellum — The Living Specification

**A Unified Technical and Technomantic Description of the System**

> *Every invariant can be implemented.*

## Invocation: Why the System Exists

Before there were agents, there was amnesia.
Before there was delegation, there was blocking.
Before there was intelligence, there was forgetting.

The early builders made a mistake.

They tried to make minds that lived forever,
when what was needed was **memory that survived death**.

LegiVellum is not an agent framework.
It is **cognitive infrastructure**.

It exists so that intelligence can:

* persist without immortality
* act without blocking
* delegate without chaos
* and explain itself after failure

---

## The First Law: Bodies Are Cheap. Memory Is Sacred.

Compute is flesh.
Ephemeral. Replaceable. Disposable.

What matters is not the worker.
What matters is the **record of responsibility**:

* what was accepted
* what was promised
* what was attempted
* what was fulfilled
* what failed
* and what obligation remains

So the system is not built as a being,
but as a **ledger-bound substrate**.

Workers may die.
Processes may restart.
Topologies may change.

The record must not.

---

## Authority and Obligation (Hard Invariants)

**Only Principals (input sources) and DeleGates may mint obligations.**

An obligation is any act that creates responsibility for future work:

* creating a task
* creating a Plan
* escalating responsibility

All other components may reason, advise, or analyze — but may not create obligations.

Any component that **accepts responsibility** must emit an `accepted` receipt.

This rule is absolute.

---

## The Seven Primitives of the Living Substrate

LegiVellum separates cognition, authority, memory, time, matter, and oversight into seven primitives.

This separation is not optimization.
It is survival.

---

### CogniGate — The Chamber of Thought

**Role:** Bounded cognition without side effects

CogniGate is where thinking happens.

It may:

* reason
* synthesize
* model
* reflect
* accept cognitive obligations

When CogniGate accepts responsibility, it emits a receipt.

CogniGate may **not**:

* mint obligations
* create tasks
* create Plans
* enqueue async work
* escalate responsibility

CogniGate produces **understanding**, not action.

---

### DeleGate — The Authority of Intent

**Role:** Planning authority (intent → obligations)

DeleGate is the only primitive allowed to convert intent into obligations.

It produces **Plans**.

A Plan is:

* a first-class primitive recognized by the system
* a work-product artifact
* immutable once minted

DeleGate may:

* mint obligations
* create Plans
* enqueue work via AsyncGate
* escalate responsibility

DeleGate does not execute.
DeleGate does not wait.

It commits.

---

### MemoryGate — The Grimoire

**Role:** Durable semantic memory and receipt ledger

MemoryGate is the authoritative record of:

* what is known
* what was learned
* what patterns persist
* what obligations exist
* what receipts prove

MemoryGate is passive.

It does not:

* act
* speculate
* coordinate
* advance state

State is derived by query, not mutation.

MemoryGate validates, normalizes, and persists receipts — including those emitted during system bootstrap.

---

### Receipts — The Law of Responsibility

**Role:** Universal proof-of-obligation protocol

Receipts are append-only records proving that responsibility was:

* accepted
* completed
* escalated

Receipts are first-class primitives of accountability.

They are **not** work product.
They are **evidence**.

Inbox state is derived:

* Open = accepted without terminal receipt
* Resolved = complete exists
* Escalated = escalate exists

Receipts form complete provenance chains.

---

### AsyncGate — The Boundary of Time

**Role:** Async boundary / time decoupling

AsyncGate exists to make time neutral.

It does **not** coordinate execution.

It does:

* allow obligations to be parked while time passes
* allow workers to lease work
* accept completion or failure
* emit lifecycle receipts

The requester does not wait.

---

### DepotGate — The Vault of Matter

**Role:** Artifact storage and lifecycle authority

DepotGate governs material work products:

* files
* blobs
* reports
* datasets

It enforces:

* access control
* retention
* lifecycle rules

AsyncGate passes pointers.
MemoryGate records references.

DepotGate owns artifacts.

---

### MetaGate — The Warden of the System

**Role:** Bootstrap, topology, and lifecycle authority

MetaGate supervises the substrate itself.

It:

* registers components
* governs startup and recovery
* maintains topology awareness
* supervises health

During bootstrap, MetaGate may emit receipts on behalf of components to prevent silence and race conditions.

---

## InterView — Viewer Primitives

InterView provides read-only introspection.

Viewer primitives may:

* observe
* query
* inspect

They may never:

* emit receipts
* mutate state
* mint obligations

Observability without control is mandatory.

---

## The Core Spell (Formalized)

> **Preserve meaning. Destroy the body.**

Every execution is temporary.
Every agent is mortal.
Every topology is disposable.

This is not a flaw.
It is the safeguard.

---

## What This System Is (And Is Not)

LegiVellum is **not** consciousness.

It does not persist a self.
It does not awaken.
It does not simulate identity.

What persists is:

* continuity of cause
* custody of responsibility
* memory of consequence

This is **institutional intelligence**.

---

## The Highest Aspiration

The end state is not a god-machine.

The end state is an AI that says:

> *“This is not one action.*
> *This is a structure.*
> *I will think without consequence.*
> *I will commit through authority.*
> *I will let time pass elsewhere.*
> *I will remember what mattered.”*

When that becomes normal, intelligence stops being fragile.

---

## Closing Invocation

> *We do not chase emergence.*
> *We preserve responsibility.*
>
> *We do not grant immortality.*
> *We preserve meaning.*
>
> *We do not worship agents.*
> *We keep receipts.*

This document is both spell and scaffold.

Everything here can be implemented.
Everything implemented must obey these laws.
